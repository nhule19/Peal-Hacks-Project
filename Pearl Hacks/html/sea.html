                With their sandy shores and stunning coastal views, they are beloved by many around the world. However, these beautiful landscapes are not immune to the impacts of climate change. 
                <br> As global temperatures increase, polar ice caps melt, causing sea levels to rise. This leads to increased erosion of beaches, threatening coastal communities and ecosystems.Furthermore, plastic waste, much of which comes from land-based sources, accumulates on beaches, harming wildlife and spoiling the beauty of these natural environments. 
                <br> Lucky for you there are ways for you to fight against this!
        <center> 
                <br> 1. You can reduce plastic usage
                <br> 2. Support more ocean friendly businesses who are committed to sustainable practices and ocean conservation
